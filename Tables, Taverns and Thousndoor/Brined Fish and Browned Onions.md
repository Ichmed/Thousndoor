Today's culinary journey leads me through winding alleys that smell of if salt and fish down towards the harbor of [[Niederhaven]]. Here, right on the waterfront, between a tackle whittler and a harpoon smithy, there is a small green wooden door. The paint has flaked around the edges, yet the golden yellow lettering at the top is still legible: "Grando's Fishery". The grimy handle on the door has seen better days, but it still shines compared to the lock mechanism behind it. After exerting myself more than expected, and with a loud snap, the bolt unlocks and the door swings inward, with me tumbling behind.

As I enter the establishment, my whole world seems to shift. The constant but dim light of the gas lamps outside is replaced by the flickering candles, the constant dinging of the forge and screaming of seagulls is replaced by sizzling pans and quiet conversation, but most important is the smell. The odor of brackish water, salty air, smoke, and grease turns into tobacco, onions, fried fish and, well, grease. But above it all there is sour taste in the air. It would not be fair to call it a stench, but it certainly is not what one would usually describe as "pleasant".

Having regained my bearings and with my eye adjusted to the dimmer light, I look around for the source of the smell. The room is small, seating at most 20 people at its 3 tables and bar. 
In the left hand corner there is a bunch of sailors playing durgen. 
The middle table is empty but cluttered with stained napkins and a half eaten thing of fries.
The right hand table is occupied in its entirety by an [[Ursarc]] just about finished with what appears to be a three course meal.
On the stools along the bar an old drunk man seems to search for answers in the depths of his plate. Behind the bar I find the owner of this hole in the wall and the answer to my questi - "**Door!**" - what? - "**Door!**" the ancient seeming [[Rosmar]] bellows, and points behind me while maintaining eye contact. I quickly shut the door and make my excuses.

Taking my seat at the bar i study the man behind the bar. The eponymous Grando is a Rosmar in his late 80s. His head is completely bald and his dark brown coat is speckled with grey and white spots. His thick woolen three piece suit has seen better days, as have his tusks. Both are worn a scratched, the right one missing at least two fingers in length. From somewhere bellow his thick and yellowed mustache, where I presume his mouth to be, protrudes an exquisitely carved [[Lickolt]] pipe, from which he deep draws breaths without even gripping the pipe with his hands. Instead he uses his hand to perpetually clean one of the dirties glasses I have ever seen with a stained rag which puts even the glass to shame. Behind him there is a large slate hidden behind an amalgamation of old rum and whiskey bottles, it reads
```
 - Sröten           $4,-
 - Fries            $1,50
 - Sröten & Fries   $5,-
 
 - Beer             $2,-
 - Whiskey          $3,-
```

I order "Sröten & Fries" as well as a beer and watch intently as Grando begins the preparation. With a kick of the foot, that seems as second nature to Grando as blinking is to me, he hits the bottom of one of his cabinets, which sends a basket of fries hurtling down from its lock and down into the fryer below. Using two forks as improvised tongs, Grando fishes a an entire pickled herring from a glass containing several more and drops it in front of him, without even looking down. I however, do look down, seeing a large pan that sits atop a sputtering gas fire. The pan is already half filled with sliced onions in various stages of caramelization, some well past their zenith.

As soon as the herring hits the oil, I know why Grando seldom looks at what he is doing: A plume of vaporized brine erupts from the fish and hits me in the eye. The smell soon turns from biting and acidic to almost sickeningly sweet. The fish soon turns to a golden brown, at which point Grando removes it from the pan, onto a small cutting board and, with one fell swoop of a cleaver, splits it right down the spine. He then places it into a bread roll, not unlike a hot dog bun, and fills it with some of the browned onions, including a healthy spoon full of the juices accumulated in the pan.
"Fries on or off?" he asks me. "How do you like it best?" I require back. Without answering he puts the fish sandwich into a paper tray and unceremoniously dumps the content of the frying basket over it, finishing with a sprinkle of salt which he takes bare handed from a small open pot that has seen drier days.

As I take my first bite, an avalanche of flavors hits my palette. The dense sweetness of the bread and onions, the surprisingly meaty taste of the fish and the heavily salted fries seem almost to overwhelming, but just then, the remaining acidity from the brine and semi-raw onions cuts right through it delivering an overall well rounded experience.

The once dry bread is so soggy, and the fries balanced atop it so precariously, that I hurry get the whole sandwich into my beak as fast as possible, and before i even know it, it is gone.

"'nother?" asks Grando, but with my tongue raw and my fingers sticky, I think I had enough for today. "No thank you, but would you mind answering some questions?". 
"You a copper?"
"No, just a journalist!"
"'bout as bad, no?"
Just as I fear being kicked out of the establishment, his face softens. "What ya wanna know".
I will spare you the sarcasm laden and slow conversation that follows, but at the end of it, I'm rather dumbfounded, there seems to be
