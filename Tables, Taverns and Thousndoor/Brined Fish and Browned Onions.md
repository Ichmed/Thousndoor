Today's culinary journey leads me through winding alleys that smell of if salt and fish down towards the harbor of [[Niederhaven]]. Here, right on the waterfront, between a tackle whittler and a harpoon smithy, there is a small green wooden door. The paint has flaked around the edges, yet the golden yellow lettering at the top is still legible: "Grando's Fishery". The grimy handle on the door has seen better days, but it still shines compared to the lock mechanism behind it. After exerting myself more than expected, and with a loud snap, the bolt unlocks and the door swings inward, with me tumbling behind.
