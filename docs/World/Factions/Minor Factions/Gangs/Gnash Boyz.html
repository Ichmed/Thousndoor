        <h1 class="title">Gnash Boyz</h1>
        <p>A gang of <span class="dead-link">None</span> <a href="/Thousndoor/World/Creatures/Undead/Ghoul.html">Ghoul</a> that are characterized by their extremely enlarged maws. Though they are sentient and like to work for hire, there is always a chance they would prefer your tasty flesh to whatever reward you care to offer them.
