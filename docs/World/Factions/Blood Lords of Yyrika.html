        <h1 class="title">Blood Lords of Yyrika</h1>
        <p>Vampires that use &lt;a href=&quot;/Thousndoor/World/Objects/Materials/Necrolithic Mist.html&quot;&gt;Necrolithic Mist&lt;/a&gt; filtered through the blood of artisan &lt;a href=&quot;/Thousndoor/World/Creatures/Undead/Ghoul.html&quot;&gt;Ghoul&lt;/a&gt; to achieve immortality without becoming Ghouls themselves.</p>
<p>Their internal organs apart from the heart will still rot causing them to be filled with dust over the years, this makes them &quot;fall to dust&quot; when killed.</p>
<p>They are very sensitive to fire and bright light since there skin will not regenerate on its own and there is no physical structure behind it to back it up.</p>
