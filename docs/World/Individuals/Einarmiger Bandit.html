<p>Lost his left arm to <a href="/Thousndoor/World/Individuals/Players/Archibald.html">Archibald</a> earning him his name.
After drinking multiple bottles of <a href="Vita%20Life">Vita Life Ultra Pro Extra with Plum flavor</a> the bandit became a <a href="/Thousndoor/World/Creatures/Undead/Ghoul.html">Ghoul</a>, grew two additional arms on his right side, and stared directly into the soul stone of <a href="/Thousndoor/World/Individuals/Ukutakunaku.html">Ukutakunaku</a>. The bandit then became obsessed with physically reaching <a href="/Thousndoor/World/Individuals/Ukutakunaku.html">Ukutakunaku</a>, creating a device to pierce the <span class="dead-link">veil</span> and ultimately being consumed by the worm.</p>
