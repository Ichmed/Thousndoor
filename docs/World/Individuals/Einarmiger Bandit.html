        <h1 class="title">Einarmiger Bandit</h1>
        <p>[Species:: Human/&lt;a href=&quot;/Thousndoor/World/Creatures/Undead/Ghoul.html&quot;&gt;Ghoul&lt;/a&gt;]
[Status:: deceased]</p>
<p>Lost his left arm to &lt;a href=&quot;/Thousndoor/World/Individuals/Players/Archibald.html&quot;&gt;Archibald&lt;/a&gt; earning him his name.
After drinking multiple bottles of <a href="Vita%20Life.md">Vita Life Ultra Pro Extra with Plum flavor</a> the bandit became a &lt;a href=&quot;/Thousndoor/World/Creatures/Undead/Ghoul.html&quot;&gt;Ghoul&lt;/a&gt;, grew two additional arms on his right side, and stared directly into the soul stone of &lt;a href=&quot;/Thousndoor/World/Individuals/Ukutakunaku.html&quot;&gt;Ukutakunaku&lt;/a&gt;. The bandit then became obsessed with physically reaching &lt;a href=&quot;/Thousndoor/World/Individuals/Ukutakunaku.html&quot;&gt;Ukutakunaku&lt;/a&gt;, creating a device to pierce the &lt;span class=&quot;dead-link&quot;&gt;veil&lt;/span&gt; and ultimately being consumed by the worm.</p>
