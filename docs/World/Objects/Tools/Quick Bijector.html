            <p>Short for &#8220;quick-use bilateral injection mechanism&#8221;. A mechanism consisting of two spring loaded syringes that can be triggered with a single button press.</p>

<p><a href="/Thousndoor/World/Objects/Tools/Quick Bijector.html">Quick Bijector</a>s are often used by <span class="dead-link">Ghoulstitcher</span>s to inject <span class="dead-link">Necroglutanates</span> into two parts at the same time while using their other hand to hold them together. This is mostly done in field-use situations, in industrial settings it is more precise and safe to use dedicated fixtures.</p>
