        <h1 class="title">Ghostblade</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Created through study of the <a href="/Thousndoor/World/Objects/Artifacts/Hilt of Yorn.html">Hilt of Yorn</a>. These blades are invisible and intangible, passing through non living material as if it did not exist. When cutting through living matter, the blade does not seem to inflict any wounds. If the blade where to inflict a mortal wound however, all previous injuries dealt to <em>anyone</em> appear at once, killing the victim instantly and injuring all other targets.</p>

<p>Ghostblades can only be used once, after their victim perishes, the blade becomes a mundane sword hilt instead.</p>

<p>Some ghostblades have been crafted into daggers, placing a shorter blade into the hilt, overlapping the longer ghostly edge, this allows for parrying strikes while maintaining the armor penetrating properties. The crafting process is very delicate, if the crafter where to cut of their fingers with the ghostblade, they would only know once the blade has slain a victim.</p>
