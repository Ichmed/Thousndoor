        <h1 class="title">The Labyrinth</h1>
        <p>A nested and twisted system of Portals that stretches throughout the known world. The nested portals create areas of un-intuitive physics which makes traversal of the labyrinth very dangerous when not sticking to secured paths.</p>

<h2>Ecology</h2>

<p>The Labyrinth is home to creatures from all over the world. While some creatures have made the labyrinth their proper home it is not unusual to stumble upon any kind of animal. Due to the confusing nature of the tunnels many animals that enter the Labyrinth will most often be lost forever, stumbling through the halls, confused and hungry.</p>

<h2>Economy</h2>

<p>Paths through the labyrinth are perilous and shifting making trips non-viable for the large scale movement of goods. </p>

<p>Smugglers however love the Labyrinth for the same reason it is shunned by merchants and transportation companies. Paths are marked with arcane symbolism and entrances are jealously guarded. Some bootleggers are even known to plant traps and misleading signage.</p>
