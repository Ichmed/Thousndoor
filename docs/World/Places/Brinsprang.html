        <p>![[Pasted image 20241214134738.png]]</p>
<p>Windswept Hilly island in the east of &lt;a href=&quot;/Thousndoor/World/Places/<em>WRK</em> WALRUS Ocean.html&quot;&gt;<em>WRK</em> WALRUS Ocean&lt;/a&gt;, home of the &lt;a href=&quot;/Thousndoor/World/Creatures/Trolls/Salt Trolls.html&quot;&gt;Salt Trolls&lt;/a&gt;.
The landscape is dotted with acidic and saline ponds which are harvested with pumps to extract salt and vinegar. 
Most vegetation can not survive here and because of the sparse brush there is little cover for animals. This leads to a desolate and barren landscape, inhospitable to most.</p>
<h2>Exports</h2>
<p>The main exports of &lt;a href=&quot;/Thousndoor/World/Places/Brinsprang.html&quot;&gt;Brinsprang&lt;/a&gt; consist of raw brine or the separated salt and vinegar. One of the largest importers of brine are the &lt;a href=&quot;/Thousndoor/World/Places/Folded Fjords.html&quot;&gt;Folded Fjords&lt;/a&gt;, where it is used as the basis for the famous pickled herring.</p>
