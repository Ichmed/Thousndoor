<p>Windswept Hilly island in the east of <a href="/Thousndoor/World/Places/_WRK_ WALRUS Ocean.html"><em>WRK</em> WALRUS Ocean</a>, home of the <a href="/Thousndoor/World/Creatures/Trolls/Salt Trolls.html">Salt Trolls</a>.
The landscape is dotted with acidic and saline ponds which are harvested with pumps to extract salt and vinegar.
