<p>Below the processing plants of <a href="/World/Places/Districts/Niederhaven/Niederhaven.html">Niederhaven</a> lie the Gunkworks, a complicated maze of sewers, steam pipes and waterways that are filled with congealed fish scraps and overrun by vermin. All these pipes terminate - nominally - somewhere far below the <a href="/World/Places/Untermeer.html">Untermeer</a> where the refuse should be "recycled" by the denizens of the depth. In practice however many pipes and pump stations have fallen into disrepair, leaking the contents of the Gunkworks into surrounding neighborhoods and caverns.</p>
