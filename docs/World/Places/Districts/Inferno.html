<p>Formerly Dreftwod, the largest Island in the the [[Deadman's Archipelago]].</p>
<p>After burning down the old town, which was a hive of scum and villainy, <a href="/Thousndoor/World/Factions/Burning Church.html">Burning Church</a> used the land to create a suburban settlement with ocean views.</p>
<p>The name is a joke, referencing <a href="/Thousndoor/World/Places/Districts/Paradiso.html">Paradiso</a> another tropical island that is also part of <a href="/Thousndoor/World/Places/Thousndoor.html">Thousndoor</a></p>
