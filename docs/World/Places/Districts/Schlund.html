        <h1 class="title">Schlund</h1>
        <p>Centered around the vertical portal to [[<em>WRK</em> Garbage Place]], Schlund is more of a geographical feature than a district. The portal is surrounded by stacked rings of garbage processing plants which offer cheap and easy disposal of refuse for the whole city. Due to safety concerns access to the area is usually prohibited.</p>
