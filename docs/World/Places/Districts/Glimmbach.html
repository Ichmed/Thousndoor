&gt;&quot;Taking a dive in the Glimmbach&quot;
&gt; - Thousndoor saying meaning &quot;to do something incredibly risky and/or stupid&quot;</p>
<p>The township of Glimmbach is dominated by the eponymous &quot;creek&quot;, a deep gash in the ground from where light and hot air escape the bowels of the earth, the shimmering of the hot air gives the appearance of water when looked at from afar.</p>
