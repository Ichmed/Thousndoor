        <h1 class="title">Jirdanwall</h1>
        <p>Nestled between building, down crevices and even throughout the Labyrinth, lies Jirdanwall, a maze of tunnels, filled with blue mushrooms and ferns, illuminated by white fireflies.
While there are rare areas that are large enough to fit a human, the Jirdanwall is mostly inhabited by &lt;a href=&quot;/Thousndoor/World/Creatures/Fae/Moon Fairy.html&quot;&gt;Moon Fairy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/Thousndoor/World/Creatures/Fae/White Coy.html&quot;&gt;White Coy&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;a href=&quot;/Thousndoor/World/Creatures/Fae/Fae.html&quot;&gt;Fae&lt;/a&gt;. 
The whole area has an otherworldly and alluring aura to non-Fae, the Fae themselves however do not seem to care or notice and simply rely on the network of tunnels for quick travel and enjoy the exclusiveness.</p>
