        <p>In the far north of [[<em>WRK</em> polar region]] there is a seemingly endless expanse of ice. On closer inspection the floor is made of a large collection of frozen bodies from <a href="/Thousndoor/World/Creatures/Carnae/Rosmar.html">Rosmar</a>, <a href="/Thousndoor/World/Creatures/Carnae/Ursarc.html">Ursarc</a> and <span class="dead-link">Humans</span>. It is tradition among many tribes of the [[<em>WRK</em> WALRUS Ocean]], for shamans near there deathbed to come to this place and join the legions of dead frozen bodies.</p>
<p><span class="dead-link">Shamans</span> visit this place and listen to the wind echoing and whispering through the latices of frozen bodies to communicate with their ancestors.</p>
