        <p>In the far north of &lt;span class=&quot;dead-link&quot;&gt;<em>WRK</em> polar region&lt;/span&gt; there is a seemingly endless expanse of ice. On closer inspection the floor is made of a large collection of frozen bodies from &lt;a href=&quot;/Thousndoor/World/Creatures/Carnae/Rosmar.html&quot;&gt;Rosmar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/Thousndoor/World/Creatures/Carnae/Ursarc.html&quot;&gt;Ursarc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;span class=&quot;dead-link&quot;&gt;Humans&lt;/span&gt;. It is tradition among many tribes of the &lt;a href=&quot;/Thousndoor/World/Places/<em>WRK</em> WALRUS Ocean.html&quot;&gt;<em>WRK</em> WALRUS Ocean&lt;/a&gt;, for shamans near there deathbed to come to this place and join the legions of dead frozen bodies.</p>
<p>&lt;span class=&quot;dead-link&quot;&gt;Shamans&lt;/span&gt; visit this place and listen to the wind echoing and whispering through the latices of frozen bodies to communicate with their ancestors.</p>
