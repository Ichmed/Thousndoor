        <h1 class="title">Cyclopian Pastures</h1>
        <p>A wide and flat area named after the <a href="/Thousndoor/World/Creatures/God Beast.html">God Beast</a>s "grazing" there.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The area is dominated by a grass steppe with very few if any trees. </p>
<p>Watering holes formed from the footsteps of the God Beasts form a vital part of the local ecosystem. Sometimes these watering holes turn rancid and turn into <span class="dead-link">Death Swamp</span>s.</p>
<p>Due to the absence of hills, mountains or forests, harsh wind sweep over the steppe which are used by the local [[<em>WRK</em> Mongols]] to power their <a href="/Thousndoor/World/Objects/Vehicles/Grass Skimmer.html">Grass Skimmer</a>s.</p>
