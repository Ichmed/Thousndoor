        <h1 class="title">Valley of Thunder</h1>
        <p>For millennia the <a href="/Thousndoor/World/Places/Die Sieben Ebenen/Kuoth.html">Kuoth</a> was though to originate here from the <span class="dead-link">Thundering Gate</span>, a vertical cave situated atop a smaller mountain, from where it torrents down. Nowadays it is know that the cave is actually a portal to <a href="/Thousndoor/World/Places/Thousndoor.html">Thousndoor</a>.</p>

<h2>Geography</h2>

<p>Here the <a href="/Thousndoor/World/Places/Die Sieben Ebenen/Kuoth.html">Kuoth</a> is less a river and more series of lakes, nestled between alpine mountains. Changes in water level are almost imperceptible due to the size of the lakes. During most of the year the top layer of the lakes is almost completely frozen, connecting small islands where hardy trees and grasses suck up the water from below.
During the "wet season", the top level melts for 1 to two months each year, forcing local wildlife to remain on what little solid land there is in the valley or move higher up into the mountains.</p>

<h2>Architecture</h2>

<p>Most of the buildings in the valley are built upon wooden stilts during the wet season and are connected to the surface of the lake via long staircases, this way the buildings can survive the wet season while always reaching the ice during the cold season.</p>
