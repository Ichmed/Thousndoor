        <p>Though it is basically impossible to reshape <a href="/Thousndoor/World/Objects/Materials/Sehstein.html">Sehstein</a>, it is possible to connect other, softer minerals and metals with via a process commonly referred to as <em>"binding"</em>. There are many different schools of <a href="/Thousndoor/World/Occupations/Sehstein Binder.html">Sehstein Binder</a>s, each with their own techniques which they keep highly secret.
In general smooth, or smooth-able, materials are used to form the base connection, as such minerals like polished marble and granite, crystals, and smooth metals are usually used. Rough materials such as sandstone, cast iron, or wood are not suited for binding.</p>
