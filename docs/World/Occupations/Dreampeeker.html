            <p>Dreamers who reach out of the dream realm back into the physical world to observe the goings on of a certain location.
For untrained practitioners the vision can be hazy and distant, however with enough training and willpower, a clear impression can be achieved.</p>

<p>To reach their destination, <a href="/Thousndoor/World/Occupations/Dreampeeker.html">Dreampeeker</a>s often travel through <a href="/Thousndoor/World/Dreams/Dreamscapes/Dreamscape.html">Dreamscape</a>s that are closely attuned to the physical world. As such it is not unlikely to meat a <a href="/Thousndoor/World/Occupations/Dreampeeker.html">Dreampeeker</a> in <a href="/Thousndoor/World/Dreams/Dreamscapes/The Nested House.html">The Nested House</a>.</p>

<p>Dreampeeking is prone to attract spirits that try to use the breach into the dreamworld to enter the physical realm. Especially common are <a href="/Thousndoor/World/Creatures/Gods, Spirits &amp; Demons/Shadelurker.html">Shadelurker</a>s, which can easily give away the presence of a <a href="/Thousndoor/World/Occupations/Dreampeeker.html">Dreampeeker</a> to people in the physical world.</p>
