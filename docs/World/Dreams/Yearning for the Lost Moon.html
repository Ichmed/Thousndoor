        <p><a href="/Thousndoor/World/Creatures/Fae/Moon Fairy.html">Moon Fairy</a> will often find themselves dreaming of a high cliff, suspended above an ocean or chasm. The sky above will be filled with countless stars, except for a conspicuous void right above them. 
They fairy is rooted on the spot and inexplicably drawn to look upon the void, yet the void itself will always evade the fairies gaze.</p>
