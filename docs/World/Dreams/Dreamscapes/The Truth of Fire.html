        <div class="content">
            <p>Visited by priests of <a href="/Thousndoor/World/Factions/GHS/Burning Church/Burning Church.html">Burning Church</a> during their ascension ritual, little is know of this <a href="/Thousndoor/World/Dreams/Dreamscapes/Dreamscape.html">Dreamscape</a> apart from its fiery nature and the fact that it seems to imbue some sort of eternal truth into the minds of visiting priests.</p>

<p>Devote members of the church may visit this place even before ascension, this is seen as a sign that their joining of the clergy is long overdue.</p>
