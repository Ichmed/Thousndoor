        <h1 class="title">The Truth of Fire</h1>
        <p>Visited by priests of &lt;a href=&quot;/Thousndoor/World/Factions/Burning Church/Burning Church.html&quot;&gt;Burning Church&lt;/a&gt; during their ascension ritual, little is know of this &lt;span class=&quot;dead-link&quot;&gt;Dreamscape&lt;/span&gt; apart from its fiery nature and the fact that it seems to imbue some sort of eternal truth into the minds of visiting priests.</p>
<p>Devote members of the church may visit this place even before ascension, this is seen as a sign that their joining of the clergy is long overdue.</p>
