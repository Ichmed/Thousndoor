        <h1 class="title">Jirda, the Lost Moon</h1>
        <p>Every full moon all <a href="/Thousndoor/World/Creatures/Fae/Moon Fairy.html">Moon Fairy</a> will visit this <span class="dead-link">Dreamscape</span>, being drowned in the bliss of moonlight and kinship with their fellow fairies. 
The dream manifests as a garden of blue flowers on a dusty white expanse of rolling hills whereupon the fairies dance and frolic the entire night.</p>
<p>Upon waking a Moon Fairy will feel a painful loss and emptiness.</p>
