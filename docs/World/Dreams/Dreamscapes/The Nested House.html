<p>The nested House is an exact replica of the real world with two main differences: It is not possible to be outside of a building and those buildings seem to posses additional rooms, hallways and doors that are not there in reality. These doors need not obey the laws of euclidic space and may lead to impossible places.
While it is impossible to leave a building to the outside, there might be doors or hallways leading to other, real, buildings.</p>
<h2>Stability</h2>
<p>Concepts or ideas placed in the nested house can be retrieved later on but the shifting nature of the Dreamscape makes this more difficult then usual.</p>
