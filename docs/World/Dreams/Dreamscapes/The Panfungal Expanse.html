        <h1 class="title">The Panfungal Expanse</h1>
        <p>Shared dream of all <a href="/Thousndoor/World/Creatures/Manitari.html">Manitari</a> and other Fungal lifeforms. The Dreamscape manifest mostly as an empty, featureless plain dotted with the spectral images of mycelium and stationary Manitari. The only divergence from this comes in the form of Manitari Hives, which appear as brilliant structures of light.</p>
<p>Though the Panfungal Expanse is not the only Dreamscape that Manitari can access, it is by far the most common one and it is assumed that all non-agent Manitari only ever dream of this place.</p>
<p>When Rogue Agents dream of the Panfungal Expanse they are hounded by Nightmares for their entire stay, making sleep highly unpleasant, which increases their already present paranoia even further.</p>
