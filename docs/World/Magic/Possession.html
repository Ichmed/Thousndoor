At the same time the <span class="dead-link">Spirit</span> or <a href="/Thousndoor/World/Creatures/Gods, Spirits &amp; Demons/Demon.html">Demon</a> confers an aspect of their personality onto the target, ranging from small changes in demeanor of the host to full unrestricted control of the victim.</p>
