        <h1 class="title">Rosmar</h1>
        <p>&lt;a href=&quot;/Thousndoor/World/Creatures/Carnae/Carnae.html&quot;&gt;Carnae&lt;/a&gt; with walrus like tusks and beards. They originate on the cold beaches and fjords of &lt;span class=&quot;dead-link&quot;&gt;<em>WRK</em> Rosmar Home&lt;/span&gt;. While they are a terrestrial species, their large blubber allows them to hunt for fish in the icy waters.</p>
<h2>Physiology</h2>
<h3>Diet</h3>
<p>While Rosmar are omnivorous, their traditional diet consists mostly of fish, whales, and other ocean dwellers, supplemented by root vegetables.</p>
<h3>Dimorphism</h3>
<p>Like all Carnae, Rosmar have males and females. Both are of similar size and stature with the most distinguishing features being the larger beards of males and the large tusks only present in post pubescent males.</p>
