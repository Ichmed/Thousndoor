        <div class="content">
            <p>A Species of bear-like <a href="/Thousndoor/World/Creatures/Carnae/Carnae.html">Carnae</a> that live in the far north of the <a href="/Thousndoor/World/Places/_WRK_ WALRUS Ocean.html"><em>WRK</em> WALRUS Ocean</a>.</p>

<h2>Anatomy</h2>

<p><a href="/Thousndoor/World/Creatures/Carnae/Ursarc.html">Ursarc</a> have a body length of 2 to 3 meters. Because their spine attaches to the back of the skull, they have a hunched-over stance when walking on two feet or sitting, making them appear shorter than they are. Their hands are paw-like and have calloused pads.</p>

<h2>Behavior</h2>

<p>Compared to most <a href="/Thousndoor/World/Creatures/Carnae/Carnae.html">Carnae</a>, <a href="/Thousndoor/World/Creatures/Carnae/Ursarc.html">Ursarc</a> are rather animalistic, as such they are not above using their teeth and claws in combat and prefer to walk on all fours rather than upright.
While <a href="/Thousndoor/World/Creatures/Carnae/Ursarc.html">Ursarc</a> are not very dexterous, they have a knack for trinkets and beads, which they usually obtain by offering their services to other species.</p>

<p><a href="/Thousndoor/World/Creatures/Carnae/Ursarc.html">Ursarc</a> live in a matriarchal society with the largest female presiding over a tribe of 15 to 50 members.
