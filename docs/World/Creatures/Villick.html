<p>One brain is shared by 5 - 15 bodies. They are commonly employed as messengers because they can relay messages over vast distances instantaneously. </p>

<h2>Basic Information</h2>
<p>Other names: Monobrains, Multis (slur)</p>
<h3>Anatomy</h3>
<p>The brain is isolated from the rest of the body in a soft shell so it can rotate almost freely (similar to an eyeball). This is to accommodate the relative rotation of the different bodies. Large differences in altitude between the bodies however can cause great discomfort. </p>
<p>If a body is severely injured or the head is severed from the torso a protective shell will form around the brain to protect the brain from further injury.</p>
<p>By moving blood to and from the brain bodies can share nutrients, this way bodies that do not have access to food or oxygen can be kept alive as long as they abstain from heavy labor.</p>
<h3>Genetics and Reproduction</h3>
<p>All bodies hatch from the same egg having formed from the  same embryo</p>
<h3>Growth Rate &amp; Stages</h3>
<p>Villik development works similar to that of vertebrates. A newborn villik will only be able to control few ore even just one body at a time. By the time they are able to walk they usually have control over all of their bodies.</p>
<h2>Additional Information</h2>
<h3>Perception and Sensory Capabilities</h3>
<p>The images recorded by multiple bodies are aggregated into a 3d model of the world. If a body is alone this leads to reduced depth perception. By sensing the rotation of the brain relative to individual bodies a villik can determine the approximate position of the bodies on a global scale. Local position is determined by a high frequency sound that is periodically emmited from the brain shell.</p>
