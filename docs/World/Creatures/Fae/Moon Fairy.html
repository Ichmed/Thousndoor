  <p>[!prose]
  For ages children were told of spirits among the stars, to watch over them, when their mothers could not.
  One lonely night, an orphan girl cried out for a friend, and the full moon obliged.
  The girl long gone, the moon fairies now wander the world in search of a home that never was.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Moon Fairies are 20 to 40 centimeters tall humanoid beings. Their white to light blue skin has a semi translucent quality similar to jade or glazed porcelain. On their back they carry dark blue wings that resemble those of butterflies or moths.</p>

<p>Moon Fairies are gender and sex-less and do not reproduce. Nobody, not even they themselves, knows of their actual origin, yet they all yearn to return to [[Jirda, the Lost Moon]], a place which appears to them in their dreams.</p>
