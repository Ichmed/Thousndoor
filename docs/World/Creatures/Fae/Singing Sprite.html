<p>Small spirits, common in the <a href="/Thousndoor/World/Places/Eternal Forest.html">Eternal Forest</a>, they vary in size and color but are usually around 10 centimeters tall and carry a singular leaf atop their head.</p>
<p>Their name stems from the fact that they perfectly mimic sounds the hear, preferring the sound of music over speech and speech over all other sounds. Due to this they are used as recording devices and instruments by sealing them in sound proof containers to maintain their "recorded" sound until needed.</p>
