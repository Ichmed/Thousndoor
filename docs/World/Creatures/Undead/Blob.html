            <p>Beings dropped from a great height into the <a href="/Thousndoor/World/Places/Districts/Dead District.html">Dead District</a>. Crushed by the fall they are cursed to continue existing as amorphous masses due to the effects of the <a href="/Thousndoor/World/Objects/Materials/Necrolithic Mist.html">Necrolithic Mist</a></p>
