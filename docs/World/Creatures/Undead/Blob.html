        <p>Beings dropped from a great height into the &lt;a href=&quot;/Thousndoor/World/Places/Districts/Dead District.html&quot;&gt;Dead District&lt;/a&gt;. Crushed by the fall they are cursed to continue existing as amorphous masses due to the effects of the &lt;a href=&quot;/Thousndoor/World/Objects/Materials/Necrolithic Mist.html&quot;&gt;Necrolithic Mist&lt;/a&gt;</p>
<p>A lucky few might be collected by &lt;a href=&quot;/Thousndoor/World/Occupations/Deathshepperd.html&quot;&gt;Deathshepperd&lt;/a&gt;s and delivered to the upper city where they can perish.</p>
<p>Being purposely thrown into the &lt;a href=&quot;/Thousndoor/World/Places/Districts/Dead District.html&quot;&gt;Dead District&lt;/a&gt; is used as a form of ultimate punishment by certain crime syndicates.</p>
