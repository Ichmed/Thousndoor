        <h1 class="title">Kumonoshi</h1>
        <p>A species of undead spider living in the <a href="/Thousndoor/World/Places/Eternal Forest.html">Eternal Forest</a>.</p>
<h2>Anatomy</h2>
<p>Adult <a href="/Thousndoor/World/Creatures/Undead/Kumonoshi.html">Kumonoshi</a> are 1 to 2 meters long, possessing 6 to 10 bone clad legs with a length of up to 1.5 meters when fully unfurled. Their abdomen is dominated by a bony structure resembling a skull.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p><a href="/Thousndoor/World/Creatures/Undead/Kumonoshi.html">Kumonoshi</a> weave nets that start out as normal threads attached to trees and rock, however the closer to the center of the net thread reaches, the further it drifts into the realm of death. If a living being passes through these nets, their soul will be torn from their body due to the momentum, leaving behind a <span class="dead-link">Zombie</span>. The <a href="/Thousndoor/World/Creatures/Undead/Kumonoshi.html">Kumonoshi</a> then feasts upon the trapped soul by reeling it back to this side of the veil inside of a woven cocoon.
If the cocoon is cut upon the soul will escape and return to its body if possible.</p>
