            <div>
            <p>Master of all misfortunes that happen at sea. Takes the form of a small, big-nosed man in a blue raincoat. While he will punish you merely for the hubris of taking to sea, disrespecting him can have even deadlier consequences.
The Great Klabauter can not walk on solid ground and will bestow gifts upon those that carry out his grudges on land.</p>

<p>Creatures that belong at sea have nothing to fear of him, however he still commands a certain respect among ocean dwellers and other sea spirits.</p>
