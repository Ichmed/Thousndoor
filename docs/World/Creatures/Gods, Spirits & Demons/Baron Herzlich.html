            <p>Bestows familiars, remedies and magical abilities in exchange for favors. While he is interested in valuable goods such as souls and sacrifices, he values entertainment above riches. He will often forgive debtors that fail to pay him, if they do so in an entertaining manner.</p>

<h2>Appearance</h2>

<p>The baron manifests as floating blue skull which will deform in order to mimic facial expressions. On more formal occasions the baron will assume the form of a suit clad man, with no skin visible and the usual blue skull in place of the mans head.
