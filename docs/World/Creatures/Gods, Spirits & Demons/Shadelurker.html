        <h1 class="title">Shadelurker</h1>
        <p>Eyes that open up on surfaces which are cast in shade. Once a light source hits the wall or a person makes active eye contact with the lurker, the eye will close and immediately vanish. <a href="/Thousndoor/World/Creatures/Gods, Spirits & Demons/Shadelurker.html">Shadelurker</a>s appear completely on their own and are harmless, however they are often attracted by <span class="dead-link">Remote Viewing</span>.</p>
<p>Because of their association with remote viewing and their general unsettling nature, <a href="/Thousndoor/World/Creatures/Gods, Spirits & Demons/Shadelurker.html">Shadelurker</a>s are often not welcome and seen as bad omens.</p>
