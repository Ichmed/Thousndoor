        <h1 class="title">Shadelurker</h1>
        <p>Eyes that open up on surfaces which are cast in shade. Once a light source hits the wall or a person makes active eye contact with the lurker, the eye will close and immediately vanish. &lt;a href=&quot;/Thousndoor/World/Creatures/Gods, Spirits &amp; Demons/Shadelurker.html&quot;&gt;Shadelurker&lt;/a&gt;s appear completely on their own and are harmless, however they are often attracted by &lt;span class=&quot;dead-link&quot;&gt;Remote Viewing&lt;/span&gt;.</p>
<p>Because of their association with remote viewing and their general unsettling nature, &lt;a href=&quot;/Thousndoor/World/Creatures/Gods, Spirits &amp; Demons/Shadelurker.html&quot;&gt;Shadelurker&lt;/a&gt;s are often not welcome and seen as bad omens.</p>
