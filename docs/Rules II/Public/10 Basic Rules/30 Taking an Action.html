        <div class="content">
            <p>Whenever a Character tries to do something that is beyond trivial, they <em>Take an Action</em>. </p>

<p>To perform an action, roll a number of six sided dice equal to one of your <span class="dead-link">Skills</span>. Which skill you choose depends on the kind of action you want to take.</p>

<p>For each <span class="dead-link">Advantage</span> you have, you may &#8220;keep&#8221; one of the dice. For every <span class="dead-link">Disadvantage</span> you have you keep one less die. Add up the value of each die you kept plus 1 for every die you didn&#8217;t keep, this is the Result of your Action.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Amount</th>
  <th>Difficulty</th>
</tr>

<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>0</td>
  <td>None, Result just determins quality of the action</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>3</td>
  <td>Easy but not trivial</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>6</td>
  <td>Medium</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>12</td>
  <td>Hard</td>

  <td>18</td>
  <td>Very Hard</td>

</tbody>

<p>The Game Master then subtracts the Difficulty of the Action (decided secretly beforehand). Based on the resulting number determine the Outcome of your action as follows:</p>

  <th>Result</th>
  <th>Name</th>
  <th>Prose</th>
</tr>

<tbody>
<tr>
  <td><code>-6 or less</code></td>
  <td>Catastrophic Failure</td>
  <td>You fail, and &#8230;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>-5 to -1</code></td>
  <td>Failure</td>
  <td>You fail</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>0</code></td>
  <td>Perfect Landing</td>
  <td>You succeed and gain an Experience point</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>1 to 5</code></td>
  <td>Narrow Success</td>
  <td>You succeed, but &#8230;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>6 to 11</code></td>
  <td>Success</td>
  <td>You succeed</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>12 or more</code></td>
  <td>Great Success</td>
  <td>You succeed, and &#8230;</td>
