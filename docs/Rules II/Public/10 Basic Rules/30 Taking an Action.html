        <h1 class="title">30 Taking an Action</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Whenever a Character tries to do something that is beyond trivial, they <em>Take an Action</em>. To learn more about actions see <a href="30%20Actions/index">the Actions chapter</a>. The steps to take an Action are as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>You describe what you are trying to accomplish and how you want to accomplish it. The Game Master <em>secretly</em> decides the <strong>Difficulty</strong> of the Action based on your description.</li>
<li>You and the Game Master agree on which <a href="20%20Skills/index">Skill</a> you are going to be using to perform the action. You roll a number of six sided die equal to your Skill Level.</li>
<li>Determine how many dice you are allowed to <strong>keep</strong>
<ul>
<li>You select a number of <a href="10%20Perks">Perks</a>, and <a href="50%20Circumstances/index">Circumstances</a> that will be beneficial in performing the Action, these are called your <strong>Advantages</strong></li>
<li>The Game Master selects a number of <a href="20%20Weakness">Weaknesses</a> and <a href="50%20Circumstances/index">Circumstances</a> that will hinder you in performing the Action, these are called your <strong>Disadvantages</strong></li>
<li>Subtract the number of <strong>Disadvantages</strong> from the number of <strong>Advantages</strong> and choose that many dice <strong>plus one</strong> (you may end up choosing zero).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Add up the value of all dice. This sum is called your <strong>Roll</strong>.
<ul>
<li>Every die you chose in <strong>Step 3</strong> counts as the number of pips on the die</li>
<li>Every other die count as a 1, no matter the number of pips it displays.   </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Subtract the <strong>Difficulty</strong> chosen in <strong>Step 1</strong> from the <strong>Roll</strong>. The Game Master uses the <strong>Outcome</strong> table below to determine what happens next.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Outcome</h3>

<p>Use this table to determine what happens after a Player takes an action. Note that some actions have fixed outcomes as described in <a href="30%20Actions/index">the Actions chapter</a>.
For all other Actions you are free to improvise.</p>

<h3>Difficulty</h3>
