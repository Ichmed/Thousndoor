        <div class="content">
            <p>You can spend Clues to ask the DM questions about certain topics, depending on how you acquired the clues. </p>

<p>You do not need to spend Clues immediately after getting them and can safe them for later. However you may no longer be able to get meaningful answers at a later point. (e.g. if you want to know where a person is, and the person has moved since you acquired the Clue, you will not be able to learn where they are <em>now</em>)</p>

<p>How many clues you have to spend for an answer, depends on the kind of answer you want.</p>

<h2>1 Clue: Yes or No</h2>

<p>A simple question in the form of &#8220;Does X exist&#8221; or &#8220;Have I ever heard of Y&#8221;. The DM may answer with &#8220;Yes&#8221;, &#8220;No&#8221;, &#8220;You don&#8217;t know"/"You can&#8217;t tell&#8221;.</p>

<h2>2 Clues: Single Word</h2>

<p>A Question that can be answered with a single word or short phrase like &#8220;How many are there&#8221;, &#8220;What color is the coach&#8221;, or &#8220;Whats his name&#8221;.</p>

<h2>3 Clues: Full sentence</h2>

<p>Any question that requires a full sentence to answer like &#8220;Where could i hide here&#8221;, &#8220;how do you defeat this monster&#8221; </p>
