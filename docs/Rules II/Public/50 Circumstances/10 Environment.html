<h3>Examples</h3>

<h4>Heavy Rain</h4>

<p>The water will be a <strong>Disadvantage</strong> when trying to ignite a fire, it will make surfaces more slippery and the drops hitting your face will make it harder to make out small or distant objects. 
On the other hand, the sound of the downpour may be of <strong>Advantage</strong> by disguising the noises of your lock picking attempt, your wet enemies might conduct electricity better and maybe you can even make out the shape of an invisible stalker in the rain.</p>

<h4>Low Hanging Branches</h4>

<p>The branches can be an <strong>Advantage</strong> when trying to climb a tree, or disguise you while you are lurking in said tree, they might even allow you to acrobatically swing from a tree limb during combat. 
The foliage might also be a <strong>Disadvantage</strong> by blocking your line of sight or tangling your long equipment, also maybe don&#8217;t run too fast here, unless you want to hit your head!</p>
