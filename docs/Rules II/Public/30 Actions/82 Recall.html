<p>On a Success, you get 1 <span class="dead-link">None</span> per Advantage you used with a minimum of 1. On a Great Success you get 2 additional clues (including a minimum of 3). You can use these to ask questions about the topic you are inquiring about. (See <span class="dead-link">Clues</span> for more information)</p>

<p>On a Catastrophic Failure you get a ==Misinformed about X== status, where X is the topic you were inquiring about. You can lose this status by ==studying up== in your <a href="50%20Off-Time">Off-Time</a>, or by another Character using the <span class="dead-link">Restore</span> Action on you with a <em>Know</em> roll about the same topic.</p>
