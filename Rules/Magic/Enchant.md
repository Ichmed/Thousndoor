Enchanting is the art of (semi-) permanently infusing a thing (an object, a person, a place, etc.) with magic. 

## Performing an Enchantment
Enchanting is a parallel and sequential Endeavor with each Attempt taking 10 minutes unless specified otherwise, the needed Effort is specified in the Spell Description. 

If more than one Character participate in the Enchantment they must all know the Spell being cast. One Character **must** Take Charge, that Character must be able to cast the Spell as an Enchantment.

At least 1 Energy needs to be spent on the Enchantment, the rest of the Attempts is paid with Mana. If a Character is *Taking Charge*, the Energy spent to do so fulfills this requirement.
