An item that was imbued with a spell counts as [enchanted](Enchant.md) however instead of using the spells "enchant" version, the spells "evoke" version is cast when a certain condition is met. *(This will usually destroy the item)*. 


> [!example]
> An arrow that explodes into a fireball when it hits a target
