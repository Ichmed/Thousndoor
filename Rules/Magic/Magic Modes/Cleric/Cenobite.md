Other Characters may assist you in casting Enchantments, even if they do not know the spell you are casting, they can not contribute more than half the needed effort *(Characters who* do *know the spell may contribute any amount of Effort as normal)*.

If you are not at a Holy Site while casting the Enchantment, it costs an additional _Common Religious Materials_.
