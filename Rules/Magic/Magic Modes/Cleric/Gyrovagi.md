You may Channel spells that target an area within 5 meters of you while moving. The spell gains the *Chant* component if it doesn't have it already. The spell must target an _area_ as opposed to a concrete *object*.

The spell will move with you while moving, retaining its relative position to you as well as it can. Depending on the type of spell it may be blocked by objects such as walls.

While standing still you may move the area relative to you #todo Movement Speed
