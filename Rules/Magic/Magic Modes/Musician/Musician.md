Musicians use the powers of melody to [[Channel]] and [[Evoke]] magic. They specialize in extending channels with single targets onto multiple ones as well as chaining and combining effects of different spells.


## Writing songs
Song writing is a repeatable [Endeavor](Endeavors).
Choose a spell you could learn and that can be channeled, the needed Effort is equal to the spells upkeep cost times 20 plus 10.
You may only roll once per day.
When the Endeavor is completed you learn that spell.
