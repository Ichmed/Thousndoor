After channeling a spell for at least 2 Rounds you may stop that channel and start channeling another spell form the same school which has an upkeep cost that is 1 higher than that of the original spell, while still paying the upkeep of the original spell.
You may chain this effect to channel spells with higher and higher upkeep costs up to a maximum of `original spell's upkeep + WIL`

>[!Example]
>If you channel a spell that has an upkeep cost of 2 Mana you may switch to one that costs 3 Mana while still paying an upkeep of 2 Mana. Once you have channeled that spell for 2 Rounds you may switch to one with an upkeep cost of 4 and so on.
