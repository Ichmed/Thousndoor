Channeling a [Spell](Thousndoor/Rules/Magic/Spell.md) causes an effect that lasts until the channel ends. 

Usually this requires an amount of [Mana](Mana.md) as upkeep. This means that your maximum [bonus Mana](Bonus Resources) is reduced by that amount while channeling *(Your bonus mana does not need to be filled for his)*. 
You may not channel a spell if you do not have enough maximum bonus Mana. 
You may channel multiple spells if you have enough bonus Mana to do so. 
You may *not* spend [Energy](Energy) to channel a spell.

Once a channel ends you regain use of your maximum bonus mana, however you do *not* regain an equivalent amount of mana *(the bonus mana stays "empty")*.
