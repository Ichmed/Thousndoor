Stamina is used to perform actions that exert you beyond usual. 

Stamina can be spent instead of 1 AP, this will not reduce the cost of an action below 1 AP

If a Character runs out of Stamina they go unconscious but will _not_ bleed out if left unattended *(unless they are also out of Health)*. They become conscious again if they regain any amount of stamina.

You regain all Bonus Stamina after a Short Rest
