Mana is spend to cast spells. 

Channels and some items will reduce your maximum Bonus Mana, while you may spend Energy as Mana, you may not reduce your maximum Energy to pay for these. If you regain this maximum Bonus Mana you do *not* regain an equal amount of mana (the mana is "empty")

If a Character is out of Mana they can not cast any spells *(including spells that cost 0 Mana and Channels)*

You can regain Mana by finishing a Full Rest or through Meditations
