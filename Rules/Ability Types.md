# Types
## Spell
Active Abilities that usually cost Mana. *(Note: there are abilities that use Mana that are **not** Spells)*.
Spells must be cast in a chosen *Mode* (the three main modes are Evoke, Channel and Enchant, but more exist), and will have differing effects based on the mode. Spells can only be cast using Modes the caster knows and can use for that spell.
## Maneuver
Abilities that can modify an attack (usually given some condition). Maneuvers can not be used on their own.
## Augment
Abilities that can modify a spell (usually spell of a specific type or mode). Augments can not be used on their own. Augments do not have an elemental type, but may only be applicable to spells of a certain element and/or change the element of a spell.
## Passive
Abilities that are always active.
## Reaction
Abilities that can be used in response to some event.
## Movement
After using a *Movement* Ability, a Character is considered _moving_. *(Note: There are Abilities that change your position without physically moving you)*
