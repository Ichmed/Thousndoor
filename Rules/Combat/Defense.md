The defense of a Character is calculated as the sum of the following layers. 
If an effect depends on being negated by one of these layers, resolve them from the bottom up, e.g. if the effect depends on being blocked by your armor, the Attack must be higher than your **Evasion** + **Parry**.
You may force an attack to be negated by a specific layer e.g. to negate with your armor, you stand still and do not Parry. If you do this you must declare so **before** the attack is rolled and have to deal with the consequences if your Defense is no longer high enough to negate the attack.
## 0. Size
A Character has +2 Defense for every size below **Medium** and -2 Defense for every size above.
## 1. Magical Resistance
Any magical effect that increases your Defense
## 2. Armor
Armor specifies a bonus to your Defense.
## 3. Parry
If you actively Parry an attack, add a bonus to your Defense depending on the weapon you use. You can not parry while you are staggered.
## 4. Evasion
As long as you are able to freely move, your Defense is increase by Mobility + your Awareness. If you are staggered you do not add your Mobility
