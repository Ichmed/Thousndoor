When you get an attack result of 10+, you may do one of the following
- **Precision:** You may freely choose the damage of this attack from all possible values. This includes the result of any damage dice and Bonus Damage.
- **Power**: Increase the base Damage by 2 *(if the damage is multiplied this applies before multiplication)*.
- **Reposition**: Move for 1AP without triggering opportunity attacks from the target.
- **Maneuver:** Retroactively perform a maneuver. You still pay all additional costs associated with the maneuver but are already guaranteed the hit.
- **Special Effect:** Some weapons or Abilities grant special effects upon landing a critical hit.
