If a creature is knocked back, away or up it is moved involuntarily in that direction. The distance given in meters refers to an average human of average weight, if the target differs greatly from theses dimensions, adjust the distance accordingly.

If a target that was knocked-back hits something else, both take damage equal to:
`(D * W) / 100` rounded to the nearest integer, where `D` is the remaining distance in the knock-back and `W` is the weight of the target in Kg (_note the parenthesis_).

If damage incurred this way causes the thing that was hit to be destroyed/killed, the knock-back distance is reduced by the amount needed to deal lethal damage to the thing that was hit and the original target continues to move.

A Character that was knocked back gets [staggered](Stagger.md)
