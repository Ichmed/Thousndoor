## Basic Movement
A character move a number of meters equal to their Movement Speed for 1AP

## Sprinting
A Character may spend 1 Stamina to move twice their Movement Speed for 1 AP
## Reposition
Whenever a Character makes a Melee Attack they may also move up their Movement Speed in order to get into Melee Range. If this movement is interrupted they pay 1AP instead of the cost of the attack *(they do not perform the attack)*
