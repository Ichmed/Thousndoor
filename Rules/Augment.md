Abilities that as denoted as "Augment - X" can be applied to any instance of X performed by you. All effects of the Augment are merged with the augmented effect.

Augment effects are counted as part of whatever they augment *(for example if an augment increases the damage an attack deals and a secondary effect of the attack depends on the amount of damage dealt, the augment damage is counted)*

If one or more augments reduce a cost to below 0 you do **not** regain any resources.
