Investigation is a *repeatable* *group* [Endeavor](Endeavors). Each iteration takes 10 minutes. 
Participants may spend the collected Effort to ask questions (see below). After asking questions, participants may continue to investigate and collect more Effort to ask more questions *(they keep unspent Effort)*.

The modifier for this Endeavor is 
```
Investigation + 1 Skill relevant to the location
```
e.g. 
- `Investigation + Cooking` when investigating a kitchen 
- `Investigation + Nature` when searching a forest.
### Questions
Double the effort cost for every level of difference in the sizes of the location and the object. *Example: If you look for a **small** object in a **large** room multiply the cost by 4*
- ***Presence*** 1 Effort $-$ Ask for the presence of a specific object or kind of object. You learn if and where in the searched area the object can be located, as long as the object is not hidden on purpose. 
	- *"Is there a ladle in this kitchen?"*
	- *"I look for a birch tree in the forest"*. 
  If the object is abundant enough, the DM may deduct less or no Effort.
- ***Clue*** 3 Effort $-$ Ask about a specific topic you are investigating. You learn of the presence or absence of something that can help you with the investigation. If there are multiple possible answers, you learn of the largest and most obvious answer that has not been discovered.
	- "Is there a reason they left their food in a hurry"
	- "Do I know what could have killed those trees"
- ***Uncover*** 5 Effort $-$ Find anything that has been purposefully hidden in the location. If there are multiple hidden things, you learn of one of them. If there are no undiscovered hidden things left you learn that there is no point in searching further. *(Just because you* **know** *something is hidden, does not mean you have the means to attain it, if you find a secret compartment, you may still be missing the key to open it)*

Rather then the players selecting a type of question, they should simply ask any question they want. The DM then determines what type of question applies and deducts Effort as needed. If the players need to collect more effort to answer the question the DM tells them to continue investigating.
