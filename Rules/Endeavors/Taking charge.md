- You lead an effort (Pathfinding, Investigation, Negotiation, Crafting).
- Your expertise is important
- Your expertise is _more_ important then anybody elses
- Other people are still relevant
- Maybe costs/saves energy
- The same activity shouldn't _always_ be lead by the same Character
- Characters should still specialize in which kind of activity they _Take the lead_
# Ideas
- Split into sub tasks -> 1 character = 1 Task (3 tasks?)
- "Sous-chef" = best and second best
- Advantage with bonus over several people
- Tasks cost energy -> Best person might be out of energy
