## Long Rest

Long Rests are the only way to regain Energy. After a Long Rest a Character regains all their Energy.

Characters need the following things to perform a Long rest.
- 1 Ration of Food and Water each
- A Shelter
- At least 6 hours of sleep which may be interrupted by up to 2 hours of keeping watch

If **one** of these is missing the Character only regains **half** their energy.
If **two** are missing the Character only regains **1** Energy.
If **all three** are missing the Character regains **no** Energy and the Rest does not count as a Long rest for any other purposes. *(The rest still counts as a Short Rest)*


## Preparing a Long Rest
To perform a long rest in the wild, your group needs food and shelter, unless otherwise provided you can use the Endeavors bellow to provide them.

Note that if your party has not enough energy left to perform all needed Endeavors you may take a partial Long Rest and use the energy regained from that to collect resources for a proper Long Rest.
### Collect Food and Water
**Effort:** 10 per ration
Depending on the environment the Effort per ration changes:
- **Desert**: +40
- **Tundra**: +20
- **Mountains**: +60
### Prepare Food
**Effort:** 10 per ration
**Materials:** Rations
Rations become 50% more effective *(2 rations may feed 3 people)*
### Prepare Shelter
**Effort:** 10 + 5 per person
**Materials:** Tents and sleeping bags
If you stay in the same location for a longer time you can reuse the shelter.
