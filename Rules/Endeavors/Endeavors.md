Sometimes a task can not be completed by a single person or in a single step, in this case **Endeavors** are used instead of Checks.

Each Endeavor has a difficulty called **Effort**, one or more Characters may perform Skill Checks and add up the results. Each of these Checks is called an **Attempt**. If the total sum of attempts reaches the needed Effort, the Endeavor was successful, otherwise it fails. What happens if an Endeavor succeeds or fails depends on the circumstances.
## Order and Number of Characters
**Group** Endeavors may only be attempted once, all Characters contribute at the same time, and each Character only contributes one Skill Check. If the needed Effort is not reached, the Endeavor fails immediately.
**Examples**: Pushing a heavy boulder.

**Repeatable** Endeavors are performed one Skill Check at a time where each Attempt may be performed by a different Character. The Endeavor continues for as long as it takes to reach the required Effort or until a maximum number of Attempts is reached.
**Examples**: Navigating through a forest, Interrogating a suspect, negotiations.

If an Endeavor is **both** a group and a repeatable Endeavor, multiple Characters may perform Skill Checks at the same time, and they may continue to do so until the Endeavor is finished or until a maximum number of Attempts is reached. Skill Checks performed at the same time count as one Attempt.
**Examples**: Searching a room, preparing a fortress for siege.
## Costs
Unless specified otherwise, each Skill Check a Character performs during an Endeavor costs 1 Energy.
Major Exceptions: 
- Purely physical Endeavors cost 1 Stamina, 
- When Enchanting only 1 Energy needs to be spent, the rest of the cost is paid in Mana.

Additionally each Attempt will take some amount of time. 

| Endeavor | Time per Attempt |
| ---- | ---- |
| Navigation | 1h |
| Moving heavy object | 5min |
| Negotiation | 30min |
| Investigation | 30min |
## Taking Charge
Before any Attempts are made, one Character may pay 1 Energy to _take charge_ and become the leader of the Endeavor.
Other Characters may use the minimum result they could roll using the leaders Skill Bonus instead of the result they rolled *(2 + the Characters Base Attribute + the leaders Skill Bonus)*.

Example: 
*Steve the ranger with +3 to Navigation takes charge of navigating out of the forest. 
During navigation Paul the rogue goes scouting. 
Paul has a Navigation bonus of +0, an INS of 0 and rolls a 4. 
Since Steve has +3 to navigation, Paul's roll is treated as a 5 (2 + 0 + 3) instead of a 4. 
If Paul had an INS of 2, the result would be treated as a 7 (2 + 2 + 3).*
