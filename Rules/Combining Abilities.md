Some Abilities allow you to combine two or more Active Abilities. When Abilities are combined they are performed as one Action, taking the same amount of time as the longest Ability in the combination.

If you need to perform rolls as part of one of the combined abilities, you still roll separately.

Even if you _could_ combine two Abilities, there Implements or Conditions can still prevent you from doing so.
