To unlock a feat a number of conditions need to to be fulfilled:
- You must fulfill the list of required previous feats
- You must have collected 5 experience for that feat
- You must fulfill all achievements for that feat
## Tasks and Experience
Each feat has a list of tasks to collect experience, each task states how much experience is gained by completing it. To actually gain the experience you need to take a long rest after fulfilling the task. 
## Achievements
Some feats have a list of achievements that must be completed before attaining that feat. Unlike Tasks, Achievements are one and done. Once you complete an achievement it counts towards any and all Feats that require it. If an achievement of yours gets somehow reverted, all Feats that require it, and subsequently all feats that are based on them, are _deactivated_, you will regain access to all of them immediately upon regaining the Achievement.

If something you did qualifies for to tasks on the same feat, you gain the experience for both. 

If something you did could count towards multiple feats, you must choose one of them and only gain experience in that feat.
