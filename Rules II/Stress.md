When you fail certain _Skill Checks_ or do not react to a _Situation_ you gain Stress. Stress can be physical or psychological. If you reach 5 Stress points in either category, remove the stress and gain a new _Problem_. If you would gain your fourth Problem in either category, your Character is _Out of Commission_ instead.
## Redirecting Stress
Instead of marking Stress on your character directly, you can redirect it to one of your Traits instead. For example if you have an "Armor" Trait, that trait may be able to take physical Stress. If you have an "Old friend" Trait, that can absorb psychological Stress.
If Accumulated Stress on a Trait creates a Problem, that Problem belongs to the trait and does not count to your maximum. 

You can have two Problems on a trait no matter what, if you gain more, new Problems replace a Perk on that trait (you keep the skill increase). You can not replace the _Title Perk_ this way. If all non-title _Perks_ are gone and you would gain another Problem, remove the entire trait instead.

## Removing Stress
You can perform the _Sooth_ action to remove Stress points.
## Removing Problems
Problems can not be removed by a simple Action, they need to be dealt with in the form of actions your character takes in the course of the story.
