## Base
Roll dice equal to your _Skill Value_, for every die, you may choose to keep the actual value you rolled or treat it as a 1. In order to keep the die you must justify doing so by using one of your _Advantages_ (_Perks_, _Buffs_ or a current _Situation_). You may only use a each _Perk_ or _Situation_ once per Skill Check.

Each Check has penalty that is deducted from the Result:

| Amount | Difficulty                                        |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 0      | None, Result just determins quality of the action |
| 3      | Easy but not trivial                              |
| 6      | Medium                                            |
| 12     | Hard                                              |
| 18     | Very Hard                                         |

The final value determines the outcome:

| Result        | Name                 | Prose                | Stress point? |
| ------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- | ------------- |
| `-6 or less`  | Catastrophic Failure | You fail, and ...    | Yes           |
| `-5 to 0 `    | Failure              | You fail, unless ... | Yes on fail   |
| `  0 to 5 `   | Narrow Success       | You succeed, but ... | No            |
| ` 6 to 11`    | Success              | You succeed          | No            |
| ` 12 or more` | Great Success        | You succeed, and ... | No            |
## Disadvantages
When you declare an _Advantage_ for a die, the DM can invoke one of your _Weaknesses_, one of your _Problems_, or a _Situation_ to counter that Advantage. You may then declare a new _Advantage_ to use for that die.
## Sacrifice an Advantage
After rolling, you may decide to sacrifice one or more _Advantages_ to gain an additional die for each. You keep that die and treat it as at least a 2.
- If the _Advantage_ was a _Perk_, you mark it as deactivated.
	Example: "I throw my sword"
- If the _Advantage_ was a _Buff_ or _Position_, it is removed from the game.
	Example: "I jump down from the rafters" or "I unleash my magical Charge" 
- If the _Advantage_ is a Situation, the DM must allow you to use it, it is then removed from the game
