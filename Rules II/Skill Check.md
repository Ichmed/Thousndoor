## Base
Roll dice equal to your _Skill Value_, for every die, you may choose to keep the actual value you rolled or treat it as a 1. In order to keep the die you must justify doing so by using one of your _Perks_ or a current _Situation_. You may only use a each _Perk_ or _Situation_ once per Skill Check.

Each Check has penalty that is deducted from the Result:

| Amount | Difficulty                                        |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 0      | None, Result just determins quality of the action |
| 3      | Easy but not trivial                              |
| 5      | Medium                                            |
| 10     | Hard                                              |
| 15     | Very Hard                                         |
| 20     | Extremely Hard                                    |
The final value determines the outcome:

| Result        | Name                 | Prose                | Stress point? |
| ------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- | ------------- |
| `-6 or less`  | Catastrophic Failure | You fail, and ...    | Yes           |
| `-5 to 0 `    | Failure              | You fail, unless ... | Yes on fail   |
| `  0 to 5 `   | Narrow Success       | You succeed, but ... | No            |
| ` 6 to 11`    | Success              | You succeed          | No            |
| ` 12 or more` | Great Success        | You succeed, and ... | No            |
