A trait consists of 5 parts:
- [Perks](10%20Perks) Written as a perk name and skill name. 
	- The name can be used as Advantage
	- The listed Skill is increased by 1
	- The name and skill should be thematically tied to each other, but are in no way related during game play
	- The first Perk in each Trait is called the "Title Perk" and should set the theme for the whole Trait
- [Weakness](20%20Weakness) Written as word or short phrase
	- Can be counted as a Disadvantage
	- May cause additional Stress when an Action fails
	- Can not be removed
- [Stress](30%20Stress) Written as a 6 pip indicator that can be filled in
	- Instead of marking Stress on you Character you can mark it on a Trait if it is appropriate
	- If Stress reaches 6, it is reset and you get a Problem on this Trait
- [Problems](40%20Problems) Written as a List of names
	- Can be counted as disadvantages
	- Starting with the 3rd Problem, they override Perks (you keep the Skill bonus)
	- If a Problem would override the Title Perk, remove the whole Trait instead and you go into [[Crisis]]
	- Problems can be removed through game play
- [Experience](50%20Experience) Written as a 6 pip indicator that can be filled in
	- When Experience reaches 6, it is reset and you gain a new Perk
	- You gain Experience by
		- Solving a Problem
		- Performing a [[Perfect Landing]]
		- [[Dedicating time]] to a [[Feature]]
	- Whenever you mark Experience on a Trait, you also mark Experience on your Character
