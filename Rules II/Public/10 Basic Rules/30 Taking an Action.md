Whenever a Character tries to do something that is beyond trivial, they _Take an Action_. To learn more about actions see [the Actions chapter](../30%20Actions/index). The steps to take an Action are as follows:

1. You describe what you are trying to accomplish and how you want to accomplish it. The Game Master *secretly* decides the **Difficulty** of the Action based on your description.
2. You and the Game Master agree on which [Skill](20%20Skills/index) you are going to be using to perform the action. You roll a number of six sided die equal to your Skill Level.
3. Determine how many dice you are allowed to **keep**
	- You select a number of [Perks](../40%20Traits/10%20Perks), and [Circumstances](../50%20Circumstances/index) that will be beneficial in performing the Action, these are called your **Advantages**
	- The Game Master selects a number of [Weaknesses](20%20Weakness) and [Circumstances](../50%20Circumstances/index) that will hinder you in performing the Action, these are called your **Disadvantages**
	- Subtract the number of **Disadvantages** from the number of **Advantages** and choose that many dice **plus one** (you may end up choosing zero).
4. Add up the value of all dice. This sum is called your **Roll**.
	- Every die you chose in **Step 3** counts as the number of pips on the die
	- Every other die count as a 1, no matter the number of pips it displays.	
5. Subtract the **Difficulty** chosen in **Step 1** from the **Roll**. The Game Master uses the **Outcome** table below to determine what happens next.

### Outcome
Use this table to determine what happens after a Player takes an action. Note that some actions have fixed outcomes as described in [the Actions chapter](30%20Actions/index).
For all other Actions you are free to improvise.

| Result        | Name                 | Description                              |
| ------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `-6 or less`  | Catastrophic Failure | You fail, and ...                        |
| `-5 to -1 `   | Failure              | You fail                                 |
| `0`           | Perfect Landing      | You succeed and gain an Experience point |
| `  1 to 5 `   | Narrow Success       | You succeed, but ...                     |
| ` 6 to 11`    | Success              | You succeed                              |
| ` 12 or more` | Great Success        | You succeed, and ...                     |
### Difficulty
The Difficulty of an Action should be roughly as follows. Note that the minimum Roll possible is always a 2.

| Amount | Difficulty                                        |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 2      | None, Result just determins quality of the action |
| 5      | Easy but not trivial                              |
| 10     | Medium                                            |
| 15     | Hard                                              |
| 20     | Very Hard                                         |
