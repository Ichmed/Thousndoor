Whenever a Character tries to do something that is beyond trivial, they _Take an Action_. The steps are as follows:

1. You describe what you are trying to accomplish and how you want to accomplish it
2. You and the Game Master agree on which Skill you are going to be using to perform the action.
3. The Game Master **secretly** decides the **Difficulty** of the Action based on your description in **Step 1**.
4. You roll a number of six sided die equal to your Skill Level.
5. You select a number of [Perks](10%20Perks), and [[Circumstances]] that will be beneficial in performing the Action, these are called your **Advantages**
6. The Game Master selects a number of [Weaknesses](20%20Weakness) and [[Circumstances]] that will hinder you in performing the Action, these are called your **Disadvantages**
7. Subtract the number of Disadvantages from the number of Advantages and choose that many dice **plus one**.
8. Add up the value of all dice. Every Die you chose in **Step 7** counts as the number of pips on the die, every other die count as 1, no matter the number of pips it displays. This sum is called your **Roll**.
9. Subtract the **Difficulty** chosen in **Step 3** from the **Roll**. The Game Master uses the **Outcome** table below to determine what happens next.

### Outcome
Use this table to determine what happens after a Player takes an action. Note that some actions have fixed outcomes as described in [the Actions chapter](30%20Actions/index).
For all other Actions you are free to improvise.

| Result        | Name                 | Description                              |
| ------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `-6 or less`  | Catastrophic Failure | You fail, and ...                        |
| `-5 to -1 `   | Failure              | You fail                                 |
| `0`           | Perfect Landing      | You succeed and gain an Experience point |
| `  1 to 5 `   | Narrow Success       | You succeed, but ...                     |
| ` 6 to 11`    | Success              | You succeed                              |
| ` 12 or more` | Great Success        | You succeed, and ...                     |
### Difficulty
The Difficulty of an Action should be roughly as follows. Note that the minimum Roll possible is always a 2

| Amount | Difficulty                                        |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 2      | None, Result just determins quality of the action |
| 5      | Easy but not trivial                              |
| 10     | Medium                                            |
| 15     | Hard                                              |
| 20     | Very Hard                                         |
