Whenever a Character tries to do something that is beyond trivial, they _Take an Action_. 

To perform an action, roll a number of six sided dice equal to one of your [[Skills]]. Which skill you choose depends on the kind of action you want to take.

For each [[Advantage]] you have, you may "keep" one of the dice. For every [[Disadvantage]] you have you keep one less die. Add up the value of each die you kept plus 1 for every die you didn't keep, this is the Result of your Action.

| Amount | Difficulty                                        |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 0      | None, Result just determins quality of the action |
| 3      | Easy but not trivial                              |
| 6      | Medium                                            |
| 12     | Hard                                              |
| 18     | Very Hard                                         |

The Game Master then subtracts the Difficulty of the Action (decided secretly beforehand). Based on the resulting number determine the Outcome of your action as follows:

| Result        | Name                 | Prose                                    |
| ------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `-6 or less`  | Catastrophic Failure | You fail, and ...                        |
| `-5 to -1 `   | Failure              | You fail                                 |
| `0`           | Perfect Landing      | You succeed and gain an Experience point |
| `  1 to 5 `   | Narrow Success       | You succeed, but ...                     |
| ` 6 to 11`    | Success              | You succeed                              |
| ` 12 or more` | Great Success        | You succeed, and ...                     |
