You can spend Clues to ask the DM questions about certain topics, depending on how you acquired the clues. 

You do not need to spend Clues immediately after getting them and can safe them for later. However you may no longer be able to get meaningful answers at a later point. (e.g. if you want to know where a person is, and the person has moved since you acquired the Clue, you will not be able to learn where they are _now_)

How many clues you have to spend for an answer, depends on the kind of answer you want.

## 1 Clue: Yes or No
A simple question in the form of "Does X exist" or "Have I ever heard of Y". The DM may answer with "Yes", "No", "You don't know"/"You can't tell".
## 2 Clues: Single Word
A Question that can be answered with a single word or short phrase like "How many are there", "What color is the coach", or "Whats his name".
## 3 Clues: Full sentence
Any question that requires a full sentence to answer like "Where could i hide here", "how do you defeat this monster"
