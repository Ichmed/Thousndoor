You can spend Clues to ask the DM questions about certain topics, depending on how you acquired the clues. 

You do not need to spend Clues immediately after getting them and can safe them for later. However you may no longer be able to get meaningful answers at a later point. (e.g. if you want to know where a person is, and the person has moved since you acquired the Clue, you will not be able to learn where they are _now_)

How many clues you have to spend for an answer, depends on the kind of answer you want.

## 1 Clue: Yes or No
