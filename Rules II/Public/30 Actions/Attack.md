Roll _Fight_, the _Difficulty_ depends on the kind and amount of enemies. On a success, the enemy takes Stress equal to the result. On Failure you take Stress equal to the negative result for all of these.

| Difficulty | Example                     |
| ---------- | --------------------------- |
| 0          | Small child, elderly person |
| 3          | Normal guy                  |
| 6          | Muscular Guy                |
| 12         | Soldier, City Guard         |
| 18         | Troll                       |

The final value determines the outcome:
