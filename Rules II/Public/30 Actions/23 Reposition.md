When you try to change your position, and another Character tries to stop you from doing so, you must take the _Reposition_ Action.

Roll _Move_. 
The _Difficulty_ depends on the kind and amount of enemies. 

On Success, you may move to another room or gain an _Advantage_. 
On a Great Success you may do both.

## Examples
### Hidden Bandit
>[!Fluff]
>Flink the Araku runs from a bunch of thugs and hides in an abandoned warehouse

Perks: Nimble, Cat Burglar, Climbing Equipment

On a success, Flink moves from "The Street" into "The Warehouse".
On a great success he also gets the Position ==In the Rafters==
