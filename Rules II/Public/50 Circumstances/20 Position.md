Each Character can at most have one Position, if they would gain another Position, it replaces the old one.

A position is always an Advantage, having no Position simply means not having an advantageous position compared to other Characters in the same Scene.

### Examples
#### In the Rafters
You have climbed onto a beam high above the rest of the scene. You may attack from up there, granting an additional advantage, or Sacrifice your position by dropping down for a surprise attack.

#### Hidden in a closet
You have an advantage hiding from pursuers or might have an easier time overhearing a conversation
