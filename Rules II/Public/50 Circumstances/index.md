Circumstances are things that could be an **Advantage** or a **Disadvantage**, depending on the situation. Circumstances are always spatially and/or temporally constraint in some way.
Circumstances that would be an **Advantage** for an opponent are counted as **Disadvantages** for the player and vice versa.
