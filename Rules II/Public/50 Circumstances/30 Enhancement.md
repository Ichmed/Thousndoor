Enhancements are Circumstances that are semi-permanently attached to a Character. Each Trait can only create one Enhancement per Character at a time.

They range from physical items (Sword, Protective Gear), over magical improvements (Ignited Weapon, Superhuman Strength), to purely emotional or spiritual conditions (Motivation, Concentration)
