<p>A gang of <a href="Trolls">Troll</a> [[Ghoul]] that are characterized by their extremely enlarged maws. Though they are sentient and like to work for hire, there is always a chance they would prefer your tasty flesh to whatever reward you care to offer them.
Gnash Boyz use few words, when not talking food. They are built like that. Less talk, more action.

<p>The Gnash Boyz fear and worship the [[Gnawing Teeth]]</p>
