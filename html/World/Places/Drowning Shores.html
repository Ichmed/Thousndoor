<p>[!prose] Drowning Giant
The wet sand is dotted with deep humanoid footsteps, some new, some almost indistinguishable from the surrounding after being worn down by the tides. A gurgling noise fills the air, interspersed with wet coughing. The source is not far, a few hundred meters down the shore, a human head, tall as a grown man, pokes out from the sand. Its eye sockets are empty and the giants face is half submerged in the slick ground, a continuous stream of seawater and sand flowing into its mouth, only to be ejected again a few minutes later in a sudden coughing fit. Slowly the sea rises, and when it recedes, the giant will have sunken further into the ground, as it has every day for over a year.</p>

<p>The northern coast of the [[Cyclopian Pastures]], named after the [[God Beast]]s stuck in the muddy beaches.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The flat landscape of the Pastures slowly descends into the ocean with a barely noticeable slope, due to this the tides reach over a kilometer inland each day, creating an area of extremely muddy and salty soil.</p>
<p>Smaller [[God Beast]]s wandering in from further inland sometimes get stuck and slowly sink into the mud where they appear to drown. Larger beasts can be observed striding in and out of the ocean unimpeded.</p>
