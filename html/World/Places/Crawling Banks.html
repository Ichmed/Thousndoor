<p>A collection of sandbanks out in the <a href="/World/Places/_WRK_ WALRUS Ocean.html"><em>WRK</em> WALRUS Ocean</a> where the backs of <a href="/World/Creatures/God Beast.html">God Beast</a>s wandering the bottom of the ocean sometimes crest the waves. Especially large specimens might emerge from the waves entirely.</p>
