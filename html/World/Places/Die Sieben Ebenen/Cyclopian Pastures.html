<p>A wide and flat area named after the [[God Beast]]s "grazing" there.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The area is dominated by a grass steppe with very few if any trees. </p>
<p>Watering holes formed from the footsteps of the God Beasts form a vital part of the local ecosystem. Sometimes these watering holes turn rancid and turn into [[Death Swamp]]s.</p>
<p>Due to the absence of hills, mountains or forests, harsh wind sweep over the steppe which are used by the local [[<em>WRK</em> Mongols]] to power their [[Grass Skimmer]]s.</p>
