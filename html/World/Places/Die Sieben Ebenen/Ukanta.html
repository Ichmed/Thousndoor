<p>Part of the [[<em>WRK</em> Crocoid Empire]] and home of the [[Wappenmännchen]].</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>A large scrub desert specked with mesas. A rather thin layer of sand, 20m at most, covers a thick layer of sandstone.
The [[Kuoth]] has dug its way through the landscape creating a network of peninsulas and oxbows along which most of the population live.
While water is sparse out in the desert, nightly dew condenses on mesa cliffs and flows downwards creating lush oasis where multiple mesas are close together. </p>
<h2>Wildlife</h2>
<p>The sandstone below the desert is a breeding ground for [[Soul Gorger Wurm]]s, whose tunnels in turn form the basis for a lot of the subterranean biosphere.
[[<em>WRK</em> Six legged fire things]] are native to the desert and are used by locals to keep crops warm at night.</p>
<h2>Economy</h2>
<p>The main exports of the area consist of cereals farmed alongside the [[Kuoth]] and metals extracted from ore by the skilled geomancers of the [[Wappenmännchen]]</p>
