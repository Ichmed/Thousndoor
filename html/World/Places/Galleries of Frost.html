<p>In the far north of [[<em>WRK</em> polar region]] there is a seemingly endless expanse of ice. On closer inspection the floor is made of a large collection of frozen bodies from [[Rosmar]], [[Ursarc]] and [[Humans]]. It is tradition among many tribes of the [[<em>WRK</em> WALRUS Ocean]], for shamans near there deathbed to come to this place and join the legions of dead frozen bodies.</p>
<p>[[Shamans]] visit this place and listen to the wind echoing and whispering through the latices of frozen bodies to communicate with their ancestors.</p>
