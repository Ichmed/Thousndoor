<p>Small neighborhood located next to the portal to the <span class="dead-link">Straight of Orhan</span> named due to fact that sea-dwelling animals from the straight sometimes swim up the portalway, dropping down into the <a href="/World/Places/Untermeer.html">Untermeer</a>, which in the case of the occasional whale is quite spectacular, coating the neighborhood in sea foam and whale blubber.</p>
