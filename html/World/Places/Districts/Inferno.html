<p>Formerly Dreftwod, the largest Island in the the [[Deadman's Archipelago]].</p>
<p>After burning down the old town, which was a hive of scum and villainy, [[Burning Church]] used the land to create a suburban settlement with ocean views.</p>
<p>The name is a joke, referencing [[Paradiso]] another tropical island that is also part of [[Thousndoor]]</p>
