<p>Giant tree that grows through a portal, having multiple crowns on both sides. The roots tunnel down into [[The Labyrinth]] and from there into all regions of the world. This confuses the internal clock of the tree causing it to continuously grow and shed leaves resulting in an impression of permanent fall. </p>
<p>The sickly appearance of the tree caused its inhabitants to be shunned in [[Wiedenwald]] because it was seen as a bad omen. Having gained immense power due to their access to [[Thousndoor]] the [[Joharbian Legion]] now seeks revenge by suppressing all other tree dwellers</p>
