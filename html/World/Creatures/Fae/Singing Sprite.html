<p>Small spirits, common in the [[Eternal Forest]], they vary in size and color but are usually around 10 centimeters tall and carry a singular leaf atop their head.</p>

Due to this they are used as recording devices and instruments by sealing them in sound proof containers to maintain their "recorded" sound until needed.</p>
