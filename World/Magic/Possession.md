[[Spirit]]s and [[Demon]]s have the ability to infuse their essence into living beings and inanimate objects. Doing so grants the target of the possession certain physical and metaphysical properties. 
At the same time the [[Spirit]] or [[Demon]] confers an aspect of their personality onto the target, ranging from small changes in demeanor of the host to full unrestricted control of the victim.
