The northern coast of the [[Cyclopian Pastures]] named after the [[God Beast]]s stuck in the muddy beaches.

## Geography
The flat landscape of the Pastures slowly descends into the ocean with a barely noticeable slope, due to this the tides reach over a kilometer inland each day, this creates an area of extremely muddy and salty soil.
Smaller [[God Beast]]s wandering in from further inland sometimes get stuck and slowly sink into the mud where they appear to drown. Larger beasts can be observed striding in and out of the ocean unimpeded by the mud.
