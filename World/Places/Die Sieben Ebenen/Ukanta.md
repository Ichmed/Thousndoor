Part of the [[_WRK_ Crocoid Empire]] and home of the [[Wappenmännchen]].
## Geography
A large scrub desert specked with mesas. A rather thin layer of sand, 20m at most, covers a thick layer of sandstone.
While water is sparse over all, nightly dew condenses on mesa cliffs and flows downwards creating lush oasis where multiple mesas are close together. 
## Wildlife
The sandstone below the desert is a breeding ground for [[Soul Gorger Wurm]]s, whose tunnels in turn form the basis for a lot of the subterranean biosphere.
[[_WRK_ Six legged fire things]] are native to the desert and are used by locals to keep crops warm at night.
## Economy
The main exports of the area consist of cereals farmed alongside the oasis and metals extracted from ore by the skilled geomancers of the [[Wappenmännchen]]
