Biome: Thorn steppe

Situated between [[Thousndoor]] and [[Ebene 2]]

The [[Kut]] meanders through this rugged landscape dotted with sparse trees and steppe grass. Along the river basin intricate irrigation systems powered by windmills turn the ever present brown dust of the valley into nutrient rich mud used to raise all kinds of cereal plants.
