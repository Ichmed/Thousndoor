A wide and flat area named after the [[God Beast]]s "grazing" there.

## Geography
The area is dominated by a grass steppe with very few if any trees. 

Watering holes formed from the footsteps of the God Beasts form a vital part of the local ecosystem. Sometimes these watering holes turn rancid and turn into [[Death Swamp]]s.

Due to the absence of hills, mountains or forests, harsh wind sweep over the steppe which are used by the local [[_WRK_ Mongols]] to power their [[Grass Skimmer]]s.
