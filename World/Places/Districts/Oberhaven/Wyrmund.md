The great [[Gateway]] between the [[Folded Fjords]] and [[Niederhaven]]. About 100 meters tall, the lower 40 meters lie beneath the salty waters of the [[_WRK_ WALRUS Ocean]]. While the tides here are less extreme due to the long thin fjord leeding up to the [[Gateway]], there is still a small flood gate about two kilometers from the gate, used to negate the tides inside of the [[Wyrmund]] entirely.

Being rather short, about 15 meters, there is not much infrastructure inside the actual gateway apart from some lighting fixtures.

## Travel
The [[Wyrmund]] can exclusively be passed by ferry or cargo ship
