The great [[Gateway]] between the [[Folded Fjords]] and [[Niederhaven]]. About 100 meters tall, the lower 40 meters lie beneath the salty waters of the [[_WRK_ WALRUS Ocean]]. While the tides here are less extreme due to the long thin fjord leeding up to the [[Gateway]], there is still a small flood gate about two kilometers from the gate, used to negate the tides inside of the [[Wyrmund]] entirely.

Being rather short, about 15 meters, there is not much infrastructure inside the actual gateway apart from some lighting fixtures.

## Travel
The [[Wyrmund]] can exclusively be passed by ferry or cargo ship, due to the limited capacity inside the fjord and tunnel, there are strict time tables to be kept, these are managed by the [[Office of Throughput]]. If a ship misses its window they can be forced to be moored in [[Niederhaven]] or hoisted on the walls of [[Oberhaven]] for day, weeks, sometimes even months. The [[Swingin' Gabolin]] is said to be the oldest still "waiting" ship.
