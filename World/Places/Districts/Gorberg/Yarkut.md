Named after the original small settlement on the far side of the Portal, [[Yarkut]] is now the main [[Gateway]] connecting [[Yyrika]] and [[Thousndoor]].

## Architecture
The [[Gateway]] is fitted with a three level, bidirectional road fashioned from [[Lickolt]] which is used as the main highway for large goods moving to and from [[Yyrika]]. The sides of the Portal are lined with half timbered buildings consisting mostly of taverns, hotels and [ghoul](Ghoul.md) stables.
