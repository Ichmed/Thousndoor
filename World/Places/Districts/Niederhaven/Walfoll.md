Small neighborhood located next to the portal to the [[Straight of Orhan]] named due to fact that sea-dwelling animals from the straight sometimes swim up the portalway, dropping down into the [[Untermeer]], which in the case of the occasional whale is quite spectacular, coating the neighborhood in sea foam and whale blubber.
