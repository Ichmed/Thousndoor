Below the processing plants of [[Niederhaven]] lie the Gunkworks, a complicated maze of sewers, steam pipes and waterways that are filled with congealed fish scraps and overrun by vermin. All these pipes terminate - nominally - somewhere far below the [[Untermeer]] where the refuse should be "recycled" by the denizens of the depth. In practice however many pipes and pump stations have fallen into disrepair, leaking the contents of the [[Gunkworks]] into surrounding neighborhoods and caverns.
