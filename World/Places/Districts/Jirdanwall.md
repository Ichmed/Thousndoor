Nestled between building, down crevices and even throughout the Labyrinth, lies Jirdanwall, a maze of tunnels, filled with blue mushrooms and ferns, illuminated by white fireflies.
While there are rare areas that are large enough to fit a human, the Jirdanwall is mostly inhabited by [[Moon Fairy]], [[White Coy]] and other [[Fae]]. 
The whole area has an otherworldly and alluring aura to non-Fae, the Fae themselves however do not seem to care or notice and simply rely on the network of tunnels for quick travel and enjoy the exclusiveness.
