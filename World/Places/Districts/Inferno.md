Formerly Dreftwod, the largest Island in the the [[Deadman's Archipelago]].

After burning down the old town, which was a hive of scum and villainy, [[The Burning Church]] used the land to create a suburban settlement with ocean views.

The name is a joke, referencing [[Paradiso]] another tropical island that is also part of [[Thousndoor]]
