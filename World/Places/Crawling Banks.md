A collection of sandbanks out in the [[Bittermeer]] where the backs of [[God Beast]]s wandering the bottom of the ocean sometimes crest the waves. Especially large specimens might emerge from the waves entirely.

The waters around the Crawling Banks are known to be dangerous for ships due to the chance of running aground atop a submerged beast.
