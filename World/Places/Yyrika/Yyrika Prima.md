The central region of Yyrika, once a collection of verdant valleys and alms its was turned into a desolate wasteland by the opening of the [[Immortal Wound]]. Now Yyrika is primarily inhabited by feral [[Ghouls]] and [[Mist Reavers]] who harvest the never ending streams of [[Necrolithic Mist]] pouring from the Immortal Wound.
