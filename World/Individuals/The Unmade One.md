A person who slew the [[God Beast of Yorn]] and was subsequently seemingly stricken from the universe. Though no records, memories or measurable traces of them remain, their absence in history left a whole so big that certain facts about them have been discerned.

At some point they performed [[The Blasphemy]] resulting in the [[Immortal Wound]] and the abundance of [[Necrolithic Mist]] in [[Yyrika]].
