[Species:: Human/[[Ghoul]]]
[Status:: deceased]

Lost his left arm to [[Archibald]] earning him his name.
After drinking multiple bottles of [Vita Life Ultra Pro Extra with Plum flavor](Vita%20Life) the bandit became a [[Ghoul]], grew two additional arms on his right side, and stared directly into the soul stone of [[Ukutakunaku]]. The bandit then became obsessed with physically reaching [[Ukutakunaku]], creating a device to pierce the [[veil]] and ultimately being consumed by the worm.
