[Species:: Human/[[Ghoul]]]
[Status:: deceased]

After drinking multiple bottles of [Vita Life Ultra Pro Extra with Plum flavor](Vita%20Life) this bandit stared directly into the soul stone of [[Ukutakunaku]], which drove him mad. The bandit then became obsessed with physically reaching [[Ukutakunaku]], creating a device to pierce the [[veil]] and ultimately being consumed by the worm.
