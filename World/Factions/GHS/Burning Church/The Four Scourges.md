[[Burning Church]] doctrine states that all bodily, spiritual and societal ills in the world can be traced back to the four great scourges of the world, each of which can be cleansed away with the divine power of fire.
# Crushing Weeds
**Symbol**: Triskelion of barbed vines
Invasive plants, weeds and unproductive native flora which threaten the food supply and must be exterminated by slash and burn or else risk famine. On a societal level the weeds represent social parasites and useless eaters that need to be removed from the populace.
# Stagnant Waters
**Symbol**: Mosquito
Tide pools, oxbow lakes, puddles and old wells are breeding grounds for vermin, malaria and stomach disease. To keep the populace healthy, the water needs to be boiled. On a societal level, stagnant people are rich bureaucrats and merchants that sit on their wealth leading hedonistic and degenerate lives.
# Festering Flesh
**Symbol**: Maggot
Rancid meat, spoiled fat and untreated wounds spread sickness and vermin. To remedy or prevent this, the flesh must be cauterized by flame. On a societal level the festering are career criminals and ruffians, who constantly undermine society. The church views vigilantism in response to these elements as equivalent to the inflammation of a wound: Natures attempt to manifest the necessary holy fire.
# Sickening Stench
**Symbol**: Cloud
Bad odors cling to the air in places of decay, causing illness of the body and mind, unless cleared away by incense and smoke. On a societal level the stench is the muttering and false testament of infidels that clouds the mind and prevents enlightenment.
