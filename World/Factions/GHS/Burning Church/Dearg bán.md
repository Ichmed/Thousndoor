A combination of paramilitary, vigilantes, proselytizers, and inquisition, the Dearg bán, or Red-Whites, are a semi autonomous group within the [[Burning Church]]. The [[Dearg bán]] draw their members from both clergy and laymen, relying more on devotion than formal training to keep order in their ranks.
