Vampires that use [[Necrolithic Mist]] filtered through the blood of artisan [[Ghoul]] to achieve immortality without becoming Ghouls themselves.

Their internal organs apart from the heart will still rot causing them to be filled with dust over the years, this makes them "fall to dust" when killed.

They are very sensitive to fire and bright light since there skin will not regenerate on its own and there is no physical structure behind it to back it up.
