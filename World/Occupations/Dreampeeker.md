Dreamers who reach out of the dream realm back into the physical world to observe the goings on of a certain location.
For untrained practitioners the vision can be hazy and distant, however with enough training and willpower, a clear impression can be achieved.

To reach their destination, [[Dreampeeker]]s often travel through [[Dreamscape]]s that are closely attuned to the physical world. As such it is not unlikely to meat a [[Dreampeeker]] in [[The Nested House]].

Dreampeeking is prone to attract spirits that try to use the breach into the dreamworld to enter the physical realm. Especially common are [[Shadelurker]]s, which can easily give away the presence of a [[Dreampeeker]] to people in the physical world.
