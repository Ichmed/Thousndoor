You sit in a room with no windows or doors.
On the table in front of you there is a single candle or other source of light.
It illuminates a document of some kind.
You can neither stand up nor turn your head.
There is somebody or _something_ behind you.
As you pick up the document you know its full content even though the text makes no sense or is indecipherable.
Moments later the light extinguishes itself and you wake up, still knowing the contents of the document.
