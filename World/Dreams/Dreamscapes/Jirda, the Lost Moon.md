Every full moon all [[Moon Fairy]] will visit this [[Dreamscape]], being drowned in the bliss of moonlight and kinship with their fellow fairies. 
The dream manifests as a garden of blue flowers on a dusty white expanse of rolling hills whereupon the fairies dance and frolic the entire night.

Upon waking a Moon Fairy will feel a painful loss and emptiness.
