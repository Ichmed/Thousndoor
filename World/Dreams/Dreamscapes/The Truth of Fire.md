Visited by priests of [[The Burning Church]] during their ascension ritual, little is know of this [[Dreamscape]] apart from its fiery nature and the fact that it seems to imbue some sort of eternal truth into the minds of visiting priests.

Devote members of the church may visit this place even before ascension, this is seen as a sign that their joining of the clergy is long overdue.
