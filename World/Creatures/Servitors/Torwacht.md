A kind of servitor that consists of a torso, a small head, and two big four pointed shields attached to its arms. the two shields can be pressed together to form a hexagonal wall used to block passage through [[Sechstein]] tunnels, most importantly [[Portal]]s.

A skilled [[Servomancer]] can open and close the gates if they have access to the [[Servitor]]'s head.
