Fungus based lifeforms that consist of one or more immobile hives and a number of mobile drones. The number of drones, as well as their size, can range widely. While a young hive may only consist of a handful of drones there are also ancient hives with millions if not billions of drones.
# Types
## Agents
Sometimes a hive produces a special kind of drone called an Agent. These drones are equipped with a fully functioning brain and are sapient. Agents are mostly used to interface with other sapient species that do not like to integrate their central nervous system directly into the hive.
## Rogue Agents
If an Agent gets to far from their original hive, they sometimes turn rogue, meaning they no longer have any drive to follow their hives orders. These individuals are often quite paranoid, as the hive may send out other agents to forcefully reintegrate them into the hivemind. 
The only salvation for these individuals is to accumulate enough carbohydrates (most often in the form of sugar or flour) to perform a metamorphosis into a new hive.
# Trade
Due to their fungal nature, manitari are able to perform many fermentation processes at will. They use this ability to trade for resources with surrounding sapient species. The most common arrangement consist of shipments of base materials (sugar, flour, etc.) which are then partially turned into derivatives (sourdough, rum, etc.) while the hive keeps the rest as payment.

Manitari are only interested in currency insofar that it can be traded for carbohydrates, they usually do not partake in banking, corporations or other complicated monetary endeavors.
