Moon Fairies are 20 to 40 centimeters tall humanoid beings. Their white to light blue skin has a semi translucent quality similar to jade or glazed porcelain. On their back they carry dark blue wings that resemble those of butterflies or moths.

Moon Fairies are gender and sex-less and do not reproduce. Nobody, not even they themselves, knows of their actual origin, yet they all yearn to return to [[Jirda, the Lost Moon]], a place which appears to them in their dreams.
