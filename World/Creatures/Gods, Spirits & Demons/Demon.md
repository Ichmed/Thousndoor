Demons are often created from fears or nightmares, which they than seek to reinforce in order to strengthen their own power.

Being created by the collective unconscious, demons are classed as a type of [[Spirit]] that can enter the material world. There are two main differences between Demons and [[Fae]]: Firstly, Demons can not permanently exist in the Material world, secondly, there are no "types" or "species" of Demon, each Demon is a completely unique individual.

If a Demon is killed in the material world, they are not gone forever, instead they will re-form after some time. They do however lose most of their memories between incarnations and are not known to hold grudges against their killers, though some are notorious for holding grudges against people that did _not_ kill them.
