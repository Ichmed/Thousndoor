Beings dropped from a great height into the [[Dead District]]. Crushed by the fall they are cursed to continue existing as amorphous masses due to the effects of the [[Necrolithic Mist]]

A lucky few might be collected by [[Death Shepherds]] and delivered to the upper city where they can perish.

Being purposely thrown into the [[Dead District]] is used as a form of ultimate punishment by certain crime syndicates.
