God beasts are giant quadrupedal beings with gaunt humanoid faces that slowly roam the landscape of many regions. They do not seem to require nourishment and seem to live forever which has given to many religious and supernatural believes surrounding them.

God beasts range in size from a shoulder height of 50 meters up to multiple kilometers. Although no upper limit has been successfully established.

The only Godbeast know to ever have been slain by mortal hands was the [[Godbeast of Yorn]] whose corpse now forms the [[Immortal Wound]].

Another dead Godbeast forms the [[Cadaver of Irgos]]
