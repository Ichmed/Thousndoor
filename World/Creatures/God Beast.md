God beasts are giant quadrupedal beings with gaunt humanoid faces and features that slowly roam the landscape of many regions. They do not seem to require nourishment and seem to live forever which has given to many religious and supernatural believes surrounding them.

God beasts range in size from a shoulder height of 50 meters up to many kilometers. The largest known god beast is the [[Cadaver of Irgos]] which is one of two known dead god beasts. The only god beast know to ever have been slain by mortal hands was the [[Godbeast of Yorn]] whose corpse now forms the [[Immortal Wound]].
