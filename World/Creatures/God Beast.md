> A God Beast has not destiny, and therefore can not die

God beasts are giant quadrupedal beings with gaunt humanoid faces and features, that slowly roam the landscape of many regions. They do not seem to require nourishment and seem to live forever, which has given rise to many religious and supernatural believes surrounding them.

God Beasts range in size from a shoulder height of 50 meters up to many kilometers. The largest known god beast is the [[Cadaver of Irgos]], which is one of only two known deceased God Beasts. The only God Beast known to ever have been slain by mortal hands was the [[God Beast of Yorn]], whose corpse now forms the [[Immortal Wound]].

## Anatomy
God Beasts are quadrupeds with a shoulder height of 50 meters up to an unknown limit. They are morphologically almost identical to humans with a few noticeable differences: 
- Their eye sockets are empty and grown over with skin, they posess no nose bone, leading to a skeletal appearance, and have no teeth.
- Their shoulders and hips are turned forward and the spine attaches to the back of the skull, like in non humanoid vertebrates. The arms and legs are of similar length, with the arms being slightly longer, leading to an upward tilt of the torso.
- They lack any reproductive organs, secondary sexual characteristics and have no hair.

The grey skin of the beasts appears to be impenetrable by any known means, similarly their bones seem unbreakable, with high falls leading only to dislocated joints that almost immediately snap back into place when the beast resumes movement.

God Beasts do not need to eat or breath and filling up their insides with water, sand, concrete or magma only seems to impact them as far as it weighs them down and hinders their movement.

## Behavior
God Beasts roam around the landscape, seemingly wandering aimless and unpredictably, when they encounter an obstacle in their journeys, they ignore it up to an unreasonable degree. As such God Beasts have been known to crush settlements and fortifications, fall down cliffs, walk into the ocean, and continuously walk into large obstacles, such as mountains, until they slip around them, which may take years, centuries or never occur at all.

Though their paths lead them to all kinds of places, no God Beast has ever been observed entering a portal.
