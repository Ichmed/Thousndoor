A Species of bear-like [[Carnae]] that live in the far north of the [[_WRK_ WALRUS Ocean]].
## Anatomy
[[Ursarc]] have a body length of 2 to 3 meters. Because their spine attaches to the back of the skull, they have a hunched-over stance when walking on two feet or sitting, making them appear shorter than they are. Their hands are paw-like and have calloused pads.

## Behavior
Compared to most [[Carnae]], [[Ursarc]] are rather animalistic, as such they are not above using their teeth and claws in combat and prefer to walk on all fours rather than upright.
While [[Ursarc]] are not very dexterous, they have a knack for trinkets and beads, which they usually obtain by offering their services to other species.

[[Ursarc]] live in a matriarchal society with the largest female presiding over a tribe of 15 to 50 members.
